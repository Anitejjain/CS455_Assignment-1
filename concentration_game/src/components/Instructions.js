        <h1> What is Mind Grid </h1>
        <p > In Mind Grid, you quickly memorize a group of tiles on a grid. 
            That means remembering their location, and maybe even the shapes they create.
            This task challenges a part of your short-term memory called spatial recall â€” 
            your ability to track location and position within an environment. 
                                                                              </p>

        <p className="Instruction"> Memorize the cells having colour in 5 seconds.</p>
        <p className="Instruction"> Grid will turn completely blank, try to flip all the former coloured cells.</p>
